# Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges worldwide, leading to the need for effective monitoring and strategy formulation to control the spread of the virus and minimize fatalities. This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data to identify regions with high-risk profiles and to predict key outcomes that can inform public health strategies.

# goal of this project
determine which regions are at higher risk based on COVID-19 statistics such as confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery rates
-Identify regions that require urgent intervention.
-Predict the likelihood of severe outcomes, such as high mortality rates.
-Recommend appropriate strategies for different regions based on their current data.

# Prediction Accuracy
Model Accuracy: The RandomForest model achieved an accuracy of approximately 85% on the test data.

#Conclusion
This project successfully identified regions with heightened risks and provided actionable insights to inform public health strategies. The prediction model demonstrated robust accuracy, offering a valuable tool for forecasting COVID-19 trends and aiding in decision-making processes.
